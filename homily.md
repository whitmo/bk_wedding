# Bronstein/Keach Homily


We are here because Lindsay and Steve are in love.  

They have chosen this moment to have all of you whom they deam
special, important, and influential in their lives to be here to witness
this declaration and commitment to that love and to take part in this
moment of intention.

At the end of this homily we take a moment of silence to in
rememberance of those who could be here and to meditate on this
moment. 

To that purpose, I'd like you to take to capture a moment for each of them
in your mind, a moment that emblifies whatever you hold dear about
them: 

something one of them did to make you laugh, 

a considerate act they committed on your behalf, something you learned
from them, 

a piece of their writing that touched you, 

a time when they surprised you with their kindness.

Perhaps a story that endlessly recursed back until you could not
remember why it was being told.


Perhaps a game that had been improvised on the spot that left
you tickled.


Perhaps joke, a delicious piece of cupcake, or an
insightful observation.

Something that you realized they might do that made your soul sing.

Something delectably good and true. Something that holds what you
find unique in them and you hopes for them.


Alright got it? Now hold that thought... we'll get back to it.


Now let us consider marriage. Marriage is a curious thing. 


Niether a point of departure nor a terminus of arrival, it is a
declaration in the middle of two individual's journey through life
where they come together and plant a flag and declare themselves a
sovereign entity which is beholden first and foremost to the well
being and happiness of it's founding inhabitants and dedicated to all
things in life they find meaningful and important.


Imagine if you will a very small nation complete with it's own
emerging language, cuisine, aesthetic standards, tech sector and two
cats.


So.  This no small declaration and that Steve and Lindsay are making
right now, right here in this place with so much history, before you,
the people they care about so much.


Like most thing worth doing, to what they are committing, incurs a
great risk and promises a fair amount of hard work.


For marriage, though potentially joyful and rewarding, is not inherently
easy.


But. We know you, Steve and Lindsay, have a surfeit creativity,
stubborness, pragmatism, and industry to apply to to this
endeavor. You have big hearts and big dreams to bring purpose to this
hard work of marriage.



And most importantly, you have love. 



A solid, thoughtful love full of both joy and playfulness, but also
deep consideration for the other.


We, your friends and family, have watched with delight the sweeteness
and humor you have turned toward each other in both good times and
bad.  

It has warmed our hearts to know that each of you has found
someone who you each feel sees you, respects you and takes care of you.

And we have seen evidence to justify these sentiments in each of your.

Your love will make this work ahead a joyful labor.  It may keep
up you fighting at night about the things that are important, but will let you
drop those that are not. 

It will help you listen with soft eyes when you are tired, and push
you to take care of yourself so you can take care of each other.


May your love keep open the lines of communication, and keep you
creative in the face of adversity and uncertainty.


Between you two, may your love pave the middle way. In the words of
the author Pema Choudron:


"Instead of making others right or wrong, or bottling up right and
wrong in ourselves, there’s a middle way. This middle way involves
keeping our hearts and minds open long enough to just to hang out in
that space where we’re not entirely certain about who’s right and
who’s wrong.  Because things are a lot more slippery and playful than
that. Everything is ambiguous; everything is always shifting and
changing. Could we see, hear, feel other people as they really are?"

The middle way Choudron speaks of is where a love breathes life into
marriage, which otherwise would be difficult and arbitrary and
pained. Herein lies how a marriage can be both two very willful and
independent individuals while also a singular and formidable entity.


This middle way is also instructs how we should support Lindsay and
Steve as a community.  


As they must leave space for each other to be, we must make space for
them and for each other.


As they must care for each other, we must care for them and for each
other. 


So dearly beloved, this is it. 


Here you, Lindsay and Steve are making a sacred and mindful declaration of
this choice, reverently and deliberately to be together before all that they see
as bigger than themselves in the world.

(to S&L) before each other and the love and life together you have created 

(to congregation) before us, their parents, grandparent, siblings, cousins,
friends, confidants, and kindred spirits.

before all of they believe and hold dear, both spiritual and secular 

before all that we believe to be powerful in this world and would call
upon to bless them.

before each other as they are now and before each other as they
imagine themselve, their future, perfect selves.  

before us, the rich tapestry of people who will support them as they
have so kindly supported us as they continue this journey together.

now, and for happily forever after.



So. Now Please summon back your earlier thoughts and blessings. Get
ready to focus on it. Now let us take a moment to meditate in the
space of this moment.
