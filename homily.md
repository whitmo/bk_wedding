# Bronstein/Keach Homily

Author / Buddhist Nun Pema Choudron: 

"Instead of making others right or wrong, or bottling up right and
wrong in ourselves, there’s a middle way. This middle way involves
keeping our hearts and minds open long enough to just to hang out in
that space where we’re not entirely certain about who’s right and
who’s wrong.  Because things are a lot more slippery and playful than
that. Everything is ambiguous; everything is always shifting and
changing. Could we see, hear, feel other people as they really are?"

You, present in the moment, willing to listen, able to hear, speaking
only what is kind, necessary, staying open to possiblity will keep you
safe and happy till the end of your days."



We are here because Lindsay and Steve are in love.  

And those 

@@ why how in love yay ok?!
@@ sweetness

They have chosen this moment to have all of you whom they deam
special, important, influential in their lives to be here to witness
this declaration and commitment to that love and to take part in this
moment of intention.

To that purpose, I'd like you to take a moment to capture each of them
in your mind, a moment that emblifies whatever you hold dear about
them: something one of them did to make you laugh, a considerate act
they committed on your behalf, something you learned from them, a
piece of their writing that touched you, a time when they surprised
you with their kindness and consideration.  

Perhaps a story that
endlessly recursed back until you could not remember why it was being
told.  

Perhaps A unique game that had been improvised on the spot that you
participated in. 

Perhaps A smile, a delicious piece of gluten free cupcake, an
insightful observation.

Something delectably good and true.

Now hold that in mind. We'll return to it after we take a moment to
consider this moment of union.

Marriage is a curious thing. We stand here niether truly at the
beginning or end of us or them, but a declared point in between.  This
is a ritual of the observation of transition, the transition of
Lindsay and Steve from two to one.

This is the point in time Lindsay and Steve have chosen for all of us to
be here with them and to meditate on their past as parts of our lives,
their union now, and the abundance of possibility of their future
together.

What they are committing, like most thing worth doing, incurs a
consequential amount of risk and promises a fair amount of hard work.

Marriage, though potentially joyful and rewarding, is not inherently easy.

But. We know these two have a surfeit creativity, stubborness, pragmatism,
and industriousness to apply to reap the rewards of taking two and
becoming one.  They also have big hearts and big dreams to bring
purpose to this hard work of marriage.

Here they are making a sacred and mindful declaration of the choice,
tempered in love, to be together before all that they see as bigger
than themselves in the world.

before each other and the love and life together they have created 

before us, their parents, siblings, parents, friends, confidants,
business partners, kindred souls

before all of they believe and hold dear, both spiritual and secular 

before all that we believe to be powerful in this world and would call
upon to bless them.

before each other as they are now and before each other as they
imagine themselve, their future, perfect selves.  

before us, the rich tapestry of people who will support them as they
have so kindly supported us as they continue this journey together.

Now please summon the memory you chose before. @@ moment of silence evocation
