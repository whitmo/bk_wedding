# Bronstein/Keach Homily

We are here because Lindsay and Steve are in love.  

They have chosen this moment to have all of you whom they deam
special, important, and influential in their lives to be here to witness
this declaration and commitment to that love and to take part in this
moment of intention.

To that purpose, I'd like you to take a moment to capture each of them
in your mind, a moment that emblifies whatever you hold dear about
them: something one of them did to make you laugh, a considerate act
they committed on your behalf, something you learned from them, a
piece of their writing that touched you, a time when they surprised
you with their kindness.

Perhaps a story that endlessly recursed back until you could not
remember why it was being told.

Perhaps A unique game that had been improvised on the spot that left
you tickled.

Perhaps A smile, a delicious piece of gluten free cupcake, or an
insightful observation.

Something delectably good and true.

Now hold those moments in mind. This is preparation for the moment of
silence at the end of the homily, while Steve and Lindsay are
meditating on their vows, we will have our own work.

Let us consider marriage. Marriage is a curious thing. 

It often seems mistaken it as simply as the outcome of love, but it's
much more specific, and deliberate than the mercurial muse of
songwriters and poets.

Niether a point of departure nor a terminus of arrival, it is a
declaration in the middle of two people's journey through life to
plant a flag and declare themselves a sovereign entity beholden first
and foremost to the well being and happiness of it's founding
inhabitants and dedicated to all things in life they find meaningful
and important.

All that they find deliscious and fascinating.  

So. This no small declaration that Steve and Lindsay are making right now,
right here in this place with so much history, before you, the people
they care about so much.

For what they are committing, like most thing worth doing, incurs a
consequential amount of risk and promises a fair amount of hard work.

Marriage, though potentially joyful and rewarding, is not inherently
easy.

But. We know you, Steve and Lindsay, have a surfeit creativity,
stubborness, pragmatism, and industry to apply to to this
endeavor. You have big hearts and big dreams to bring purpose to this
hard work of marriage.

And most importantly, you have love. 

A solid, thoughtful love full of both joy and playfulness, but also
deep consideration for the other.

We, your friends and family, have watched with delight the sweeteness
and humor you have turned toward each other in both good times and
bad.  It has warmed our hearts to know that each of you has found
someone who you each feel sees you, respects you and takes care of you.

And we have seen evidence that justifies these sentiments.

Your love will make this work ahead one a joyful labor.  It may keep
you fighting at night about the things that are important, but will let you
drop those that are not. It help you listen with soft eyes when you are
tired, and make you take care of yourself so you can take care of each
other.  

May your love keep open the lines of communication, and keep you
creative in the face of adversity and uncertainty.

Between you two, may your love pave the middle way. In the words of
the author Pema Choudron:

"Instead of making others right or wrong, or bottling up right and
wrong in ourselves, there’s a middle way. This middle way involves
keeping our hearts and minds open long enough to just to hang out in
that space where we’re not entirely certain about who’s right and
who’s wrong.  Because things are a lot more slippery and playful than
that. Everything is ambiguous; everything is always shifting and
changing. Could we see, hear, feel other people as they really are?"

Everyday the story of your marriage will change, everyday you will
grow as individuals together in thousands of small and special ways.  



@@ segue


Here they are making a sacred and mindful declaration of this choice,
tempered in love, to be together before all that they see as bigger
than themselves in the world.

before each other and the love and life together they have created 

before us, their parents, siblings, friends, confidants,
business partners, kindred souls

before all of they believe and hold dear, both spiritual and secular 

before all that we believe to be powerful in this world and would call
upon to bless them.

before each other as they are now and before each other as they
imagine themselve, their future, perfect selves.  

before us, the rich tapestry of people who will support them as they
have so kindly supported us as they continue this journey together.
